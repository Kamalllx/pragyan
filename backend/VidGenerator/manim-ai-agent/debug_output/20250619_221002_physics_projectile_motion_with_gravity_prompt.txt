You are an expert educational content creator specializing in Manim animations.
Generate a complete, production-ready Manim animation script for educational content.

CONTENT SPECIFICATIONS:
Subject: physics
Topic: projectile motion with gravity
Complexity Level: intermediate
Additional Requirements: . Include mathematical formulas, moderate animation speed, and detailed explanations. Include proper units, vector representations, and physical laws

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Create a complete Scene class that inherits from manim.Scene
2. Include proper imports: from manim import *
3. Add educational annotations and labels using Text() and MathTex()
4. Use appropriate colors and consistent styling
5. Include smooth animations with proper timing (use self.wait())
6. Add mathematical formulas where relevant using MathTex()
7. Ensure the animation is educational, clear, and visually appealing
8. Include detailed comments explaining each animation step
9. Use proper Manim syntax and latest version compatibility
10. Make animations run between 15-30 seconds total

ANIMATION STRUCTURE:
- Start with a clear title
- Introduce concepts gradually
- Use visual transitions between ideas
- End with a summary or conclusion
- Include appropriate pauses for comprehension

The code should be executable with: manim -pql script.py ClassName

Generate ONLY the Python code with proper formatting. No explanations or additional text.

Example structure for physics:
```
from manim import *

class PhysicsAnimation(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        # Title
        title = Text("Projectile Motion With Gravity", font_size=48)
        self.play(Write(title))
        self.play(title.animate.to_edge(UP))
        
        # Main content here
        
        self.wait(2)
```

Now generate the complete Manim code:
