You are an expert Manim animation developer. Create a complete, educational Manim animation.

DYNAMIC PARAMETERS:
Subject: mathematics
Topic: trignometry basic
Complexity Level: beginner
Specific Requirements: . Use simple colors, large clear labels, slow animations for easy understanding, basic concepts only, avoid complex mathematics. Show step-by-step calculations, use coordinate systems, proper mathematical notation, proofs where appropriate, clear logic flow. Ensure code is AI-generated, execution-ready with proper Manim syntax, complete animations, and no deprecated methods.

SUBJECT-SPECIFIC CONTEXT:
Show step-by-step calculations, use coordinate systems, proper mathematical notation

COMPLEXITY INSTRUCTIONS:
Use simple language, basic concepts, slow animations, and clear visual explanations

CRITICAL TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
✅ Use ONLY modern Manim v0.19.0 API methods
✅ Start with: from manim import *
✅ Create a complete Scene class with construct method
✅ Use Text() for simple text, MathTex() for math (keep simple)
✅ Use basic shapes: Circle, Rectangle, Triangle, Line, Polygon
✅ Use VGroup for grouping objects
✅ Use animations: Write, Create, FadeIn, FadeOut, Transform, Indicate
✅ Include proper self.wait() statements between animations
✅ End with self.wait(2)

FORBIDDEN (will cause errors):
❌ get_sides() method - doesn't exist
❌ get_part_by_text() method - doesn't exist  
❌ get_part_by_tex() method - doesn't exist
❌ Indicate(obj, color=X) - color parameter not supported
❌ text_alignment= - use text_align=
❌ Complex deprecated methods

ANIMATION STRUCTURE:
1. Title introduction
2. Main educational content with visual demonstrations
3. Key concepts with clear explanations
4. Examples or applications
5. Summary or conclusion

SPECIFIC CONTENT FOR TRIGNOMETRY BASIC IN MATHEMATICS:
- Create educational content specifically about trignometry basic
- Make it appropriate for beginner level learners
- Include visual representations relevant to the topic
- Add clear explanations and demonstrations
- . Use simple colors, large clear labels, slow animations for easy understanding, basic concepts only, avoid complex mathematics. Show step-by-step calculations, use coordinate systems, proper mathematical notation, proofs where appropriate, clear logic flow. Ensure code is AI-generated, execution-ready with proper Manim syntax, complete animations, and no deprecated methods.
