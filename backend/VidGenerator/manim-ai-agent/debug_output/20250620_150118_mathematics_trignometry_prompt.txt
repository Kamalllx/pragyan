You are an expert Manim developer. Create a simple, robust Manim animation.

CRITICAL: Keep it simple and ensure it works on Windows.

CONTENT:
Subject: mathematics
Topic: trignometry
Complexity: beginner
Requirements: basics of ftrignometry using examples. Use simple colors, large clear labels, slow animations for easy understanding, basic concepts only. Show step-by-step calculations, use coordinate systems, proper mathematical notation, proofs where appropriate. Ensure code is execution-ready with proper Manim syntax, complete animations, and no deprecated methods.

REQUIREMENTS:
✅ Use basic Manim elements only
✅ Simple animations with Text() and basic shapes
✅ Use standard colors: BLUE, RED, GREEN, WHITE
✅ Keep filename short for Windows compatibility
✅ Include self.wait() statements
✅ End with self.wait(2)

FORBIDDEN:
❌ Complex MathTex expressions
❌ Advanced animations
❌ Long file paths or names
❌ Experimental features
