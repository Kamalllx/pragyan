You are an expert educational content creator specializing in Manim animations.
Generate a COMPLETE, production-ready Manim animation script. 

CRITICAL: The code must be COMPLETE and syntactically correct. Do not truncate or cut off the code.

CONTENT SPECIFICATIONS:
Subject: physics
Topic: projectile motion with gravity
Complexity Level: intermediate
Additional Requirements: . Include mathematical formulas, moderate animation speed, and detailed explanations. Include proper units, vector representations, and physical laws

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Create a complete Scene class that inherits from manim.Scene
2. Include proper imports: from manim import *
3. Add educational annotations and labels using Text() and MathTex()
4. Use appropriate colors and consistent styling
5. Include smooth animations with proper timing (use self.wait())
6. Add mathematical formulas where relevant using MathTex()
7. Ensure the animation is educational, clear, and visually appealing
8. Include detailed comments explaining each animation step
9. Use proper Manim syntax and latest version compatibility
10. Make animations run between 15-30 seconds total
11. ENSURE ALL PARENTHESES, BRACKETS, AND BRACES ARE PROPERLY CLOSED
12. COMPLETE ALL CODE BLOCKS - DO NOT LEAVE ANYTHING UNFINISHED

ANIMATION STRUCTURE:
- Start with a clear title
- Introduce concepts gradually
- Use visual transitions between ideas
- End with a summary or conclusion
- Include appropriate pauses for comprehension

CODE REQUIREMENTS:
- Generate ONLY Python code, no explanations
- Make sure code is COMPLETE and EXECUTABLE
- Close all parentheses and brackets
- End all statements properly
- Include proper indentation

Example structure for physics:
```
from manim import *

class PhysicsAnimation(Scene):
def construct(self):
# Title
title = Text("Projectile Motion With Gravity", font_size=48)
self.play(Write(title))
self.play(title.animate.to_edge(UP))

text    # Main content here - COMPLETE ALL SECTIONS
    
    self.wait(2)
```
