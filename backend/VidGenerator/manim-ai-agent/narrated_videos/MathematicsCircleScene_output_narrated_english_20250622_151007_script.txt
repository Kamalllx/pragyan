Topic: Mathematics Circle
==================================================

This magical shape is called a circle, and it's a fundamental part of mathematics and our daily lives. We call this central point the 'center'. Now, if you draw a straight line that passes right through the center and touches the circle at two opposite ends, you get the 'diameter'. The total length of the boundary of the circle, like the colourful edge of a rangoli, is called the 'circumference'. Think about the giant wheels at a mela, the design of a carrom board, or even the noble Ashoka Chakra on our national flag.
