==================================================

From your school textbook to a cool YouTube video, it's all powered by something special. It's any material—like text, a video, an audio clip, or even an interactive game—that is specifically designed to help you understand a topic. That's content. That's also brilliant content. Your teacher using a chart to explain the states and capitals is creating educational content right in the classroom. Even a simple story your grandmother tells you about our rich history, like the story of Rani Lakshmibai, is a powerful form of educational content. It's a powerful and creative tool that takes many shapes and forms, all with one amazing purpose: to unlock the vast world of knowledge for you, one simple lesson at a time.
