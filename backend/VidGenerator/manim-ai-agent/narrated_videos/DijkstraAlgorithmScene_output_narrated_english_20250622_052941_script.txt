Or how Google Maps instantly calculates the fastest way to drive from Bengaluru to Chennai, navigating a complex network of highways? This concept works on something called a graph. Think of the cities as nodes. Each edge has a value, or a 'weight', which could represent distance in kilometers, or travel time in minutes. It’s a greedy algorithm, meaning it always makes the choice that seems best at that moment. Here’s how it works. All other nodes are unvisited with an initial, infinite distance. Now, from our list of unvisited nodes, we select the one with the smallest known distance from the start. From this newly visited node, we check its neighbours. If it does, we update the distance. This continues until we have visited our destination node. So, the next time you book a cab or track a package, remember the elegant logic of Dijkstra's Algorithm, working silently in the background to make our connected world more efficient.
