Topic: nuclear fission 
==================================================

Welcome to the world of nuclear fission. This collision causes the nucleus to violently split into two or more smaller nuclei. These newly freed neutrons can then trigger fission in nearby uranium atoms, starting a powerful, self-sustaining chain reaction. So, fission is the controlled splitting of an atom's core to produce immense energy.
