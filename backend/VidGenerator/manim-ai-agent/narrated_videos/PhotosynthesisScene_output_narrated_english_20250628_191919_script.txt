==================================================

The secret is a magical process called photosynthesis. Using sunlight as its energy source, the plant takes in carbon dioxide from the air we breathe out, and water absorbed by its roots from the soil. It uses this energy to convert the simple ingredients into its food â€“ a sugar called glucose, which fuels its growth. So, photosynthesis doesn't just feed the plant; it's the foundation of almost every food chain and gives us our precious atmosphere.
